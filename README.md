# Cultural Consensus Theory with PyMC
### Project Assisted with AI

####  The Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) was implemented with PyMC to analyze plant knowledge data, with 10 informants responding to 20 questions. The model is deisgned to estimate both informant competence (Di) and consensus answers (Zj) using a shifted Beta(2,1) prior that favors higher competence values, while ensuring they remain within plausible range of 0.5-1.0, and a non-informative Bernoulli(0.5) prior for consensus answers. MCMC sampling was used with 4 chains and 2,000 draws per chain, which showed excellent convergence (maximum R-hat = 1.000). Under analysis, varying competence levels among informants was identified, with P6 being most competent (D = 0.869) and P3 being least competent (D = 0.606). A natural stratification was also identified of high (P6, P5, P2, P8), medium (P7), and lower competence (P1, P10, P4, P9, P3) informants.

#### The answers from the CCT consensus differed from simple majority voting on 5 out of 20 questions (i.e 75% agreement). This highlights the key advantage of the CCT approach, as it weighs responses by estimated competence rather than treating all informants equally. When disagreements occurred, CCT tended to side with responses from more competent informants, as it identifies patterns where high-competence informants tend to agree with each other -- even when representing a numerical minority. The CCT model's posterior probabilities showed high confidence (>0.9 or <0.1) for most questions, with moderate uncertainty for questions PQ13 and PQ15. By accounting for competence differences, the CCT model produces consensus answers that more heavily weight the knowledge of more competent informants, potentially yielding more accurate results than simple aggregation methods in cultural knowledge domains.
