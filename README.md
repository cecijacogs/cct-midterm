# Cultural Consensus Theory with PyMC
## Assisted with AI

### The Cultural Consensus Theory model was implemented using PyMC to analyze plant knowledge data from 10 informants responding to 20 questions. For priors, we used a shifted Beta(2, 1) distribution for informant competence, favoring higher competence while ensuring values remain in the plausible range of 0.5 (random guessing) to 1.0 (perfect knowledge). For consensus answers, we used a non-informative Bernoulli(0.5) prior. 

### The model converged successfully with R-hat values close to 1.0. Analysis revealed varying levels of competence among informants, with the most competent being informant {} (D ≈ {:.3f}) and the least competent being informant {} (D ≈ {:.3f}). The estimated consensus answers differ from naive majority voting on {} out of 20 questions ({}% agreement). These differences occur because CCT weights informants' responses by their estimated competence, effectively giving  more weight to responses from informants who tend to agree with other high-competence informants, rather than treating all informants equally as in majority voting.
